Some of you may have seen the list going around of bad news sources. From taking
a glance at these, it looks like some are just too biased as to give unreliable
accounts, some publish just straight up false things, and some are known
satirical sources that are put out there just in case people don't know they're
fake.

Can we do a better job of helping people recognize these? Here's a GitHub repo
for a super barebones Chrome plugin. Literally all it does is look for links on
Facebook that link to sites on that list and then turns those links red. I don't
know that much about making Chrome plugins, and I don't do a ton of JavaScript
development anymore, so it doesn't even do a lot of things right (e.g., I think
it will only work on stories that load on your Newsfeed when you first load the
page, not ones that come up via AJAX requests). Is turning things red even that
useful? I don't know. Maybe this is a start. Maybe there are already better
things out there. If so, let me know, and let's publicize those. If not, let's
try to think about how to make something like this.
